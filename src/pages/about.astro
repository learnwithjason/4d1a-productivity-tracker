    <h1>About this app</h1>
    <p>
      <abbr title="Just Fucking Do It">JFDI</abbr> is an acronym for the phrase,
      "Just Fucking Do It", which I first heard from <a
        href="https://dangerouslyawesome.com/2016/08/what-jfdi-really-means/"
        >this post by Alex Hillman</a
      >.

    <h2>Why build this app?</h2>

          >productively procrastinating</a
        >.</strong
      > I want to be perfect, so I plan, prep, research, and rethink as much as
      possible to avoid actually doing the thing.
    </p>

    <h2>My productivity apps are accomplices.</h2>
    <p>
      I have dozens of todos for work thatâ€™s not actually moving me closer to my
      goals. <strong
        >I load up on items that are <em>related</em> to the thing, but let me
        avoid actually <em>doing the thing</em>.</strong
      > I use preparation as a safety blanket to protect myself from the terror
      of actually shipping an idea and letting other people see it.
    </p>

    <h2>This app is my attempt to remove that safety blanket.</h2>
    <p>
      It asks you to define the one thing you want to do, and then asks you if
      you did the thing today. <strong
        >No wiggle room. You either did the thing or you didn't.</strong
